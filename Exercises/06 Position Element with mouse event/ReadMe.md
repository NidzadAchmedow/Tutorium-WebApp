Try to drag and drop the broom in the index.html file
without the drag and drop api, only with mouse-events.

So, if you would click on the broom you should be able to
move it with the mouse and if you let your mouse key go the
broom stays in the last position you draged it.

**Files to work with - Excercise Folder:**
- index.html
- broom.svg

**Look up:**
- mousedown
- mouseup
- clientX, clientY
