# Fetch me some cat facts

In this exercise I want you to use the fetch API to get
some interessting cat facts with a click on a button.

To get some facts we are going to use a public and free
API.

Here is the [github page](https://github.com/alexwohlbruck/cat-facts) for your interest.

But do not panic! There is a good documentation how you can make
use of it.

You can find the documentaion on this [page](https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/docs/).

As we are going to fetch some facts we have to use the specific [endpoint](https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/docs/endpoints/facts.html) for it. 

There is an example how the response is structured so you are able to process it.
