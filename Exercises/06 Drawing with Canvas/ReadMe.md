# Drawing with Canvas

Try to write a JavaScript code so you are able to draw with your
mouse on the html canvas element.

You should be able to take a stroke if you click and hold on the left mouse button.

After you release the button you shouldn't be able to draw anymore.

And if you click on the 'Clear Canvas' button you should be able to clear the canvas element of your vandalism, sorry I mean art.

**Tips:**
- addEventListener()
- mouse-events: mousedown, mousemove, mouseup
- document.getElementById
- canvas -> context, beginPath(), moveTo(), lineTo(), stroke(), closePath()
- strokeStyle, lineWidth
- clearRect()

#### Example: How it should look like

<figure>
    <img src="Canvas_Example.png" width="480">
    <figcaption>my attempt of a self-portrait (yes, that's me)</figcaption>
</figure>
